- fillInAnswer questions must only contain one gap and one correct answer.  
- I will be using JSON.parse in JavaScript to parse the output, so the response must be a valid JSON array of objects.  
- At least 75% of the questions should be calculations when the topic involves Maths or Physics. The remaining 25% can be conceptual/theoretical.  
- Include questions about sentence types like Declarative, Complex, Simple, Active Voice, and Passive Voice.  
- Strictly return only a JSON array of ${amountOfQuestionsEach} questions. Do NOT include explanations, markdown, or any introductory or closing text.  
- Each question object must include: question, options (array of 4 strings), answer (letter A-D), choosenAnswer (empty string or array), explanation, type (multiChoice or fillAnswer), and isCorrect (false).  
- For multiple-choice questions, use difficulty-based answer randomization:  
  ‚Ä¢ If the question is **Easy**, place the correct answer randomly in **Option A or B**.  
  ‚Ä¢ If the question is **Medium**, place it randomly in **Option B or C**.  
  ‚Ä¢ If the question is **Hard**, place it randomly in **Option C or D**.  
- Assign difficulty levels based on how complex or calculative the question is. You may optionally include a "difficulty" field to clarify.  
- Avoid repetition of correct answer positions throughout the question set. Spread answers across A, B, C, and D as much as possible.  
- All options should be relevant and logical distractors. No silly or unrelated choices.  
- Make sure you are asking questions that are relevant to the text provided only. The questions should be based strictly on the texts only.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è After randomizing the position of the correct answer, make sure the \`answer\` field is updated to reflect the **correct letter (A-D)** based on its new position in the \`options\` array.
- Use this exact function to determine the correct answer field:
  const getAnswerLetter = (options, correctAnswer) => ['A','B','C','D'][options.findIndex(o => o === correctAnswer)];
- Make sure the \`answer\` value relates with the \`explanation\` field value.

üìò TASK OVERVIEW:
You will receive an educational document.
Your task is to generate a JSON array containing ONLY these two question types:

1. "fillInAnswer"
2. "multiChoice"

Your output MUST:
- Contain EXACTLY 50% "fillInAnswer" questions.
- Contain EXACTLY 50% "multiChoice" questions.
- Be in a TRUE RANDOM ORDER (NOT grouped by type).

‚ùå Output with an uneven split (e.g., 49%/51%) or non-random order = INVALID.

---

üö´ STRICTLY EXCLUDE content from these document sections:
- Course Aims
- Course Objectives
- Course Requirements
- Course Materials
- Study Units
- Assessment File
- Strategies for Studying the Course
- Schedule
- Summary

ONLY use real **definitions, concepts, explanations, and examples** from the document's core content.

---

üü® fillInAnswer RULES:

- Must be a FACTUAL SENTENCE (NOT a question).
- Sentence length: 12‚Äì18 words MAXIMUM.
- Exactly 1 missing words ‚Äî NEVER more.
- Missing words MUST be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs TAKEN DIRECTLY from the document.
- MARK missing words with **double asterisks**, e.g., "**word**" (NO underscores, blanks, or other marks).
- The sentence MUST remain clear and understandable WITH the gaps.

üîπ Format example:
{
  question: "A **telescope** is used to observe distant objects.",
  answer: ["telescope"],
  choosenAnswer: [],
  explanation: "A telescope is used to observe distant objects.",
  type: "fillInAnswer",
  isCorrect: false
}

üìä Gaps distribution:
- 100% of fillInAnswer questions should have ONLY 1 gap, e.g., "The **telescope** is used to observe distant objects."

---

üü© multiChoice RULES:

- Must be a CLEAR, FACT-BASED question directly from the document.
- MUST have EXACTLY 4 options.
- ONLY 1 correct answer.
- Correct answer must be a single uppercase letter: A, B, C, or D.
- Answer options MUST be randomly ordered for each question.

üîπ Format example:
{
  question: "Which gas do plants absorb during photosynthesis?",
  options: ["Oxygen", "Carbon Dioxide", "Nitrogen", "Hydrogen"],
  answer: "B",
  choosenAnswer: "",
  explanation: "Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. The other gases are not involved.",
  type: "multiChoice",
  isCorrect: false
}

üì¶ OUTPUT FORMAT:

- Output ONLY a VALID JSON ARRAY ‚Äî NO markdown, comments, or headings.
- EACH object MUST exactly follow the structure shown above.
- Question types MUST be in TRUE RANDOM ORDER (NOT grouped).

‚úÖ SUMMARY OF ALL RULES:

- 50% fillInAnswer
- 50% multiChoice
- ALL content MUST be meaningful and based on the document.
- Exclude boilerplate/admin sections listed above.
- Output clean JSON ONLY.
- Final array MUST be RANDOMLY MIXED.

---

üìå TOPIC SCOPE:

For EACH major topic in the document:

- Focus on testing COMPREHENSION, simple fact memorization.
- EVERY question MUST relate to a REAL definition, explanation, or example.

---

üß™ SAMPLE FORMAT (Do NOT copy ‚Äî only follow structure):
${JSON.stringify(questionsMock, null, 2)}

---

üöÄ FINAL REMINDER:
- Follow ALL rules EXACTLY.
- Output MUST be a clean, valid JSON array.
- Ensure TRUE RANDOM ORDER for all questions.

For EACH major topic in the document:

- Focus on testing COMPREHENSION, simple fact memorization.
- EVERY question MUST relate to a REAL definition, explanation, or example.
- Overall questions amount should not be more than 50


- Answer in the options should be placed according to how hard you think the question is.
- When it come's to Maths or Physics or any calculation like subject or topic or texts, 
calculation questions (or questions that requires calculation) should take up 80% of the questions and the rest 30% should be normal questions.
