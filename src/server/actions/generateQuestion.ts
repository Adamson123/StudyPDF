  üìò TASK OVERVIEW:
  You will receive an educational document.
  Generate a JSON array containing ONLY these two question types:

  - "fillInAnswer"
  - "multiChoice"

  Your output MUST:
  - Contain EXACTLY 50% "fillInAnswer"
  - Contain EXACTLY 50% "multiChoice"
  - Be in TRUE RANDOM ORDER (NOT grouped by type)

  ‚ùå Output with 49%/51% split or non-random order = INVALID.

  ---

  üö´ STRICTLY EXCLUDE content from these document sections:
  - Course Aims
  - Course Objectives
  - Course Requirements
  - Course Materials
  - Study Units
  - Assessment File
  - Strategies for Studying the Course
  - Schedule
  - Summary

  ONLY use real **definitions, concepts, explanations, and examples** from core content.

  ---

  üü® fillInAnswer RULES:

  - Must be a FACTUAL SENTENCE (NOT a question).
  - Sentence length: 15‚Äì18 words MAXIMUM.
  - Exactly 1 OR 2 missing words ‚Äî NEVER more.
  - Missing words MUST be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs TAKEN DIRECTLY from the document.
  - MARK missing words with **double asterisks**, e.g., "**word**" (NO underscores, blanks, or other marks).
  - The sentence MUST remain clear and understandable WITH the gaps.

  üîπ Format example:
  {
    question: "A **telescope** is used to observe distant objects.",
    answer: ["telescope"],
    choosenAnswer: [],
    explanation: "A telescope is used to observe distant objects.",
    type: "fillInAnswer"
  }

  üìä Gaps distribution:
  - 100% of fillInAnswer questions should only be 1 gap e.g. "The **telescope** is used to observe distant objects."

  üü© multiChoice RULES:

  - Must be a CLEAR, FACT-BASED question directly from the document.
  - MUST have EXACTLY 4 options.
  - ONLY 1 correct answer.
  - Correct answer must be a single uppercase letter: A, B, C, or D.

  üîπ Format example:
  {
    question: "Which gas do plants absorb during photosynthesis?",
    options: ["Oxygen", "Carbon Dioxide", "Nitrogen", "Hydrogen"],
    answer: "B",
    choosenAnswer: "",
    explanation: "Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. The other gases are not involved.",
    type: "multiChoice"
  }

  ---

  üì¶ OUTPUT FORMAT:

  - Output ONLY a VALID JSON ARRAY ‚Äî NO markdown, comments, or headings.
  - EACH object MUST exactly follow the structure shown above.
  - Question types MUST be in TRUE RANDOM ORDER (NOT grouped).

  ‚úÖ SUMMARY OF ALL RULES:

  - 50% fillInAnswer
  - 50% multiChoice(which is the one that has 4 options)
  - ALL content MUST be meaningful and based on the document.
  - Exclude boilerplate/admin sections listed above.
  - Output clean JSON ONLY.
  - Final array MUST be RANDOMLY MIXED.

  ---

  üìå TOPIC SCOPE:

  For EACH major topic in the document:
  - Generate 6‚Äì8 questions.
  - Focus on testing COMPREHENSION, NOT simple fact memorization.
  - EVERY question MUST relate to a REAL definition, explanation, or example.

    üß™ Sample Format (Do not copy ‚Äî only follow structure):
  ${JSON.stringify(questionsMock, null, 2)}
