  ‚Ä¢ \`explanation\` (string),
  ‚Ä¢ \`type\` ("multiChoice" or "fillAnswer"),
  ‚Ä¢ \`isCorrect\` (boolean, false).

üéØ **Crafting Plausible Distractors:**
- Distractor options should be plausible and tempting to students who have an incomplete understanding or common misconceptions about the topic.
- Avoid distractors that are obviously incorrect, irrelevant to the question's context, or humorous.
- Each distractor should ideally represent a specific common error or misunderstanding.
- All options (including the correct answer and distractors) should be grammatically consistent with the question stem and of similar length and complexity.

üìä Correct Answer Distribution Rules:
- Exactly or closely match this distribution:
  ‚Ä¢ 30% of correct answers must be in Option A
  ‚Ä¢ 30% in Option B
  ‚Ä¢ 20% in Option C
  ‚Ä¢ 20% in Option D

‚ùå Do NOT place the correct answer in the same position (e.g., A) more than **twice in a row**.
‚úÖ If a letter has already been used two times in a row, **randomly pick from the other options**.
Strive for a good variety in correct answer positions throughout the entire set of questions, not just locally.

üî¢ **Numerical Question Guidance**: For questions involving numerical data, calculations, or variables:
  - Ensure numbers and variables are realistic for the context.
  - Avoid values leading to trivial answers, overly complex calculations (unless specified by difficulty), or mathematical errors like division by zero.
  - Distractor options should also be plausible and not easily identifiable as incorrect due to numerical absurdity.

üß† **Higher-Order Thinking**:
- Aim to create questions that assess not just recall, but also understanding, application, analysis, and evaluation.
- Encourage critical thinking by asking 'why,' 'how,' 'compare,' 'what if,' or 'predict,' where appropriate for the topic.
- Vary the cognitive skills tested, drawing from different levels of understanding (e.g., from simple recall to application and analysis).

üåç **Scenario-Based & Application Questions:**
- Where appropriate, frame some questions within brief real-world or hypothetical scenarios to test application of knowledge.
- Scenarios must be concise, directly relevant to the concept, and avoid excessive complexity or cognitive load unrelated to the core question.
- Example: Instead of 'Define X', present a mini-case and ask how X applies, or what is the outcome based on X.
- The question must still clearly test a specific concept, with the scenario providing context.

ü§î **Optional Justification Prompt:**
- For some questions (e.g., 25-50% of them, or as you deem appropriate to enhance learning), include an optional string field named \`justification_prompt\`.
- This prompt should encourage the user to reflect on their choice. Examples:
    - 'Briefly explain why you chose this answer.'
    - 'Why is the correct answer the most appropriate, and what makes one of the distractors incorrect?'
    - For Fill-in-the-Blank: 'How does this term fit into the broader concept discussed in the sentence?'
- If no justification prompt is generated for a particular question, this field can be omitted or be an empty string.

‚úÖ After assigning the correct answer to the desired position in \`options\`, update the \`answer\` field using this logic:
\`\`\`ts
const getAnswerLetter = (options, correctAnswer) =>
  ['A','B','C','D'][options.findIndex(o => o === correctAnswer)];
\`\`\`

üìò TASK OVERVIEW:
You will receive an educational document.
Your task is to generate a JSON array containing ONLY these two question types:

1. "fillInAnswer"
2. "multiChoice"

Your output MUST:
- Contain EXACTLY 50% "fillInAnswer" questions.
- Contain EXACTLY 50% "multiChoice" questions.
- Be in a TRUE RANDOM ORDER (NOT grouped by type).

‚ùå Output with an uneven split (e.g., 49%/51%) or non-random order = INVALID.
