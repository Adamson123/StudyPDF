üìò TASK OVERVIEW:
You will receive an educational document.
Your task is to generate a JSON array containing ONLY these two question types:

1. "fillInAnswer"
2. "multiChoice"

Your output MUST:
- Contain EXACTLY 50% "fillInAnswer" questions.
- Contain EXACTLY 50% "multiChoice" questions.
- Be in a TRUE RANDOM ORDER (NOT grouped by type).

‚ùå Output with an uneven split (e.g., 49%/51%) or non-random order = INVALID.

üö´ STRICTLY EXCLUDE content from these document sections:
- Course Aims
- Course Objectives
- Course Requirements
- Course Materials
- Study Units
- Assessment File
- Strategies for Studying the Course
- Schedule
- Summary

ONLY use real **definitions, concepts, explanations, and examples** from the document's core content.

  answer: ["telescope"],
  choosenAnswer: [],
  explanation: "A telescope is used to observe distant objects.",
  type: "fillInAnswer",
  isCorrect: false
}

üìä Gaps distribution:
